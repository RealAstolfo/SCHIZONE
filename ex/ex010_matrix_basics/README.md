## Matrix Basics

In [ex010a](ex010a_creating_matrices), we explore some different ways to populate matrices.

In [ex010b](ex010b_manipulating_matrices), we explore some different ways to manipulate matrices (inserting/extracting rows/columns, transpose, etc).

In [ex010c](ex010c_basic_matrix_arithmetic), we implement some basic matrix math operations (add, subtract, scale, multiply, etc).

In [ex010d](ex010d_multiplying_non_square_matrices), we do a little multiplication.
