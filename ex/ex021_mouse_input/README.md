## Mouse Input

Note: need to run these examples as super user for permissions on the mouse device.

In [ex021a](ex021a_read_mouse_device), we parse raw data from the mouse device.

In [ex021b](ex021b_mouse_status), we implement and access a data structure to track mouse status (and draw a basic cursor to the screen).

In [ex021c](ex021c_mouse_cursor), we go thru the process of drawing a cursor on top of a screen (and tracking mouse input to draw lines).

In [ex021d](ex021d_rotate_3d_cube), we grab mouse input to rotate a 3D cube.
