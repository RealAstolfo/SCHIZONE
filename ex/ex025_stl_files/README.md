## 3D Graphics (cont.)

Note: need to run these examples as super user for permissions on the mouse device.

In [ex024a](ex024a_points), we render a point datatype in 3D.

In [ex024b](ex024b_sample_triangle), we render a basic colored triangle.

In [ex024c](ex024c_3d_faces), we render a set of faces in 3D. Can you see the problem

In [ex024d](ex024d_3d_faces_improved), we render a set of faces in 3D, accounting for distance from the viewer.
