## Bitmap Images

In [ex012a](ex012a_bitmap_basics), we generate a sample bitmap image.

In [ex012b](ex012b_basic_drawing_operations), we implement and test functions to draw pixels, lines, and circles, as well as algorithms to fill parts of the image and query pixel colors.

In [ex012c](ex012c_filled_rectangles), we draw a filled rectangle.
