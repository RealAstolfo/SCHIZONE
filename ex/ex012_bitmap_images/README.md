## Memory Allocation

In [ex011a](ex011a_alloc_and_free), we allocate and free a chunk of memory, and we evaluate the impact we had on the heap.

In [ex011b](ex011b_multiple_alloc_and_free), we allocate and free several chunks of memory, and we evaluate the impact we had on the heap.

In [ex011c](ex011c_linked_list), we implement a very simple linked-list structure using our DIY heap.

In [ex011d](ex011d_checking_for_leaks), we investigate the status of our heap, checking for potential leaks.
