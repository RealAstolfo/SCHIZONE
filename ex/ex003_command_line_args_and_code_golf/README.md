## Command Line Args and Code Golf

In [ex003a](ex003a_chmod_alternative), we implement a simple function to make a file executable. The file is provided as a command line argument.

In [ex003b](ex003b_chmod_smaller), we repeat the above, but use some techniques to shave off a few bytes.

In [ex003c](ex003c_touch_alternative), we implement a simple function to create a file. The file is provided as a command line argument.

In [ex003d](ex003d_touch_smaller), we repeat the above, but use some techniques to shave off a few bytes.

In [ex003e](ex003e_rm_alternative), we implement a simple function to delete a file. The file is provided as a command line argument.

In [ex003f](ex003f_rm_smaller), we repeat the above, but use some techniques to shave off a few bytes.
