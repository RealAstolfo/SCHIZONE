## User Input

In [ex006a](ex006a_stdin), we read and parse newline-buffered input from stdin.

In [ex006b](ex006b_capture_keypresses), we toggle the terminal into raw mode, and handle certain keypresses without newline-buffering.

In [ex006c](ex006c_game), we implement a game that takes user keypress input and reads from a high-score file.

In [ex006d](ex006d_piped_stdin), we handle input that is passed into our program via stdin from the command line.
