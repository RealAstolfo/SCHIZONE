## Rendering Text

Note: need to run these examples as super user for permissions on the mouse device.

In [ex024a](ex024a_sample_text), we render a some text to the framebuffer.

In [ex024b](ex024b_alphabetic_screensaver), we channel God through RNG.

In [ex024c](ex024c_3d_text_annotations), we annotate a 3D model with text.
