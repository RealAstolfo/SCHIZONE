## Representing Fractions

In [ex007a](ex007a_printing_floats), we test out a routine to print a diverse set of double-precision floating-point numbers, including special cases.

In [ex007b](ex007b_scientific_floats), we repeat the above with scientific notation.

In [ex007c](ex007c_printing_fixed), we test out a routine to print fixed-point numbers.

In [ex007d](ex007d_floats_speedtest), we test the speed of floating-point with a 100,000,000 iterations of a bisection algorithm to compute sqrt(2). (Note, the main attraction of floats comes from having hardware implementation and parallelizability.)

In [ex007e](ex007e_fixed_speedtest), we test the speed of fixed-point with a 100,000,000 iterations of a bisection algorithm to compute sqrt(2).

In [ex007f](ex007f_fraction_speedtest), we test the speed of fractions with a 100,000,000 iterations of a bisection algorithm to compute sqrt(2).
