## Syscalls

In [ex002a](ex002a_terminating_executables), we terminate an executable for the first time, returning a value. Use `echo $?` to see the returned value, after program execution.

In [ex002b](ex002b_exiting_via_function), we repeat the above, but using a function call. Use `echo $?` to see the returned value, after program execution.

In [ex002c](ex002c_vector_sum), we compute the sum of elements of a vector, as an example involving a few other common x86-64 asm instructions and NASM syntax elements. Use `echo $?` to see the returned value, after program execution.
